Podcasts: The Next Big Thing in Media?

Podcasts have emerged as the trendy new medium in media. But there’s still so little we know about the audience listening to this nascent form of entertainment. We know how many times a podcast is downloaded, but we don’t know audience demographics, how many people are skipping through ads, etc. That’s all about to change with Apple’s announcement this month that it is finally going to provide comprehensive analytics about listener behavior to podcast publishers. I propose using the below data to figure out which podcasts could potentially be the most lucrative, as well as seek out emerging trends in the genre.

But while Netflix is never lacking in buzz, little is known about how many viewers the streaming service’s programs actually have. (Netflix is notorious for never releasing user data.) I propose to use the dataset below to determine whether Netflix really challenges the major television networks in viewership.
